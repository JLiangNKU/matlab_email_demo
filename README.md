#Send_email (Matlab)
Some programmes run a long time, and we may be exhaust to check it again and again. We can call them a 'babysitting program.' 

This demo is to send the email by Matlab. You can insert it to the last line of your code.
When your computer finishes the program, you will receive an email.
I test it on MATLAB R2015b and Gmail(2017/3/7).

#Test
Just run `demo_email.m`.
Insert it into your babysitting program.
